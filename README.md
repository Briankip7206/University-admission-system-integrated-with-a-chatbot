# Meru University Chatbot Using NLP (AI & ML)

Project Description:


The integration of of a chatbot into any University/college website provides real time support to users in handling inquires. The chatbot is trained to take texts in natural human language,process the text and give an approximate response on its own. This covers a huge milestone by automating repetitive tasks like that of answering frequently asked questions. The admission staff in our universities often face a rough time handling huge chunks of inquiries from potential students who want to get information about the admission process. They face a challenge of even responding to similar inquiries from different student. This motivated me to come up with a chatbot that would be integrated to a university admission website and can work 24/7 to allow seamless support to users even beyond the regular office hours.
